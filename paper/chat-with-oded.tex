\section{Summary of Chat With Oded}

\subsection{Minimizing Recorded Set}
Main idea: use backward code analysis in execution time to only record enough
data about the execution to be able to recreate the execution using an SMT
solver and the program semantics.

\subsection{Data Store Recording Optimizations}
Main idea: Only record writes to data-store. On read, only record the invocation
id of the function. When recreating the run, get the read value directly from
the write source.

\subsection{Static Analysis-Theoretic Questions}
Main idea: Try to formalize the behaviours of the record-and-replay system. e.g.
how does the replay relate to the original run. Is it a simulation? Can it be
formalized as an abstract interpretation?
