The rapid adoption of serverless computing by industry has been marred by a
lack of adequate tooling for software development, with the most notable
deficiencies in tools for monitoring and debugging serverless application
deployed in public-cloud production environments.

While several attempts to provide debug and monitoring solutions for serverless
applications had been made by cloud providers and startups, a viable solution
has yet to emerge. Consequently, most users resort to such bronze-age
techniques as logging and finger-crossing to analyze executions.

The lack of proper debug and monitoring tools is further compounded by the
prevalent use of cloud-based distributed services, such as distributed
databases that provide relaxed consistency guarantees, which are hard enough to
debug in traditional environments.

In this work we present a debugging technique for serverless applications,
which combines run-time recording of function execution, with postmortem replay
capabilities and a novel technique for root-cause analysis. Our system
automatically detects potentially inconsistent reads in distributed databases,
and gives users the ability to analyze the state of the database at various
times in the execution of the application, as well as tie the each value the
database to the specific function execution that produced it.
